The collection that I have selected is HashSet. The documentation report that 
1. The time performance for the basic operations (add, remove, contains and size). 
2. There is no guarantees to maintain order of the set while iterating.

I have observed that 
1. The time performance is not constant for basic operation. 
2. The order of the set is may or may not be preserved so it is in accordance with the documentation.
